## About the story

This book follows the adventures of young Briddey Flanagan, an Irish-American woman living in a modern day where doctors have the ability to surgically increase empathy between romantic partners. Leaping at the chance to become linked to her fiancé Trent, a gorgeous young executive rocketing up the corporate ladder in her communications firm, Briddey has the surgery. 

Only, things do not go quite as she had expected... The audiobook has a lovely narration by Mia Barron, whom I have heard before.

This is the latest book (2016) by Connie Willis, whom I consider one of the most readable speculative fiction writers out there. Her quirky sense of humour and her masterful ability to imagine "what would happen if...?" make her one of my very favourite authors. She has won numerous awards (and very deservedly so, may I say?).

Sadly, the CELA library only has four of her books. Public libraries often have them in audiobook (CDs) or e-audiobook (downloadable through OverDrive) formats, however, which is how I listened to most of the ones I could access. (Thank you, [Toronto Public Library](http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?N=37920&amp;Ns=p_pub_date_sort&amp;Nso=1&amp;Ntt=willis%2C+connie)!)

The first time I encountered her was in the BRILLIANT book **To say nothing of the dog, or, How we found the Bishop's bird stump at last**. Set in a world where historians travel to various eras for research, this one features the Victorian era. I was blown away by how out-and-out hilarious this book was, and how complex and believable the plot was. I was hooked. CELA has this book, narrated by David Cutler (DA21993).

Slightly darker is her **Blackout** and **All clear** series, which CELA does not have. Set in WWII England, the time-travelling historians become embroiled in the war, its aftermath and its dangers. Compelling and readable, the historical detail is impressive and heart-wrenching.

**Bellwether** (CELA DA22417, narrated by Melanie Ray) is about advertising, chaos theory and -- you guessed it -- sheep. It's a love story.

The last one CELA has, **Impossible things** (DA20231), is a collection of short stories I am saving for when I really need cheering up. I am looking forward to it!

[Bookshare](https://www.bookshare.org/search?keyword=willis%2C+connie), of course, has everything! You need access to a DAISY player, and the ability to listen to a machine voice for a long time.
