CELA library call number DA480602007. 417 pages in the paperback edition, 11 hrs., 26 min. as a recorded book.\nAbout the story\rAfter suffering a tragic loss, a Dorsetshire family moves to Georgian-era London at the invitation of a circus owner. Setting up a chair-making workshop in their small upstairs apartment, the Kellaway family set about making a new life for themselves, encountering colourful neighbours such as the publisher and artist William Blake, the streetwise Maggie Butterfield and the mesmerising circus owner Philip Astley.\nThe author paints a vivid picture of life in the early 1790s, with lots of well-researched detail and an engaging plot. There are several strands to the story, which mostly follows young Jem Kellaway’s adventures through the streets of London with Maggie and tells the story of his sister, Maisie.\nThe story is interesting and well written. The descriptions of the time and the setting are memorable, and it feels like the book ends just a bit too soon. Jill Tanner’s narration is well done, and she is very pleasant to listen to, in my opinion.\nRecommended?\rThis is a very readable story with both male and female protagonists."},"title":"Burning Bright by Tracy Chevalier"},"/blog/canadian-copyright-a-citizens-guide-by-laura-murray/":{"data":{"about-the-book#About the book":"","about-the-book-1#About the book":"About the bookAuthor: Murray, Laura J. with Samuel E. Trosow\nTitle: Canadian copyright: A citizen’s guide. (2nd edition)\nPublication: Toronto : Between the Lines, 2013. ISBN 9781771130134.\nAbout the book\rI initially read the first edition of this book in 2007. I was struck by how clearly the authors explained the history of copyright in Canada. They clearly demonstrate how that history informs Canadian law, and how the law informs the practice of individuals and groups across our society.\nIronically, it is often much easier for Canadians to be informed about “fair use” (an American copyright principle, as opposed to “fair dealing”, used in Canada) and the DMCA than it is to know about the laws that govern our daily practice here in Canada. This book goes a long way towards addressing this lack of understandable information in Canada.\nThis second edition has been revised and expanded to include the many changes brought about by [Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act]{http://copyright.ubc.ca/copyright-legislation/bill-c-11-the-copyright-modernization-act/), which amended Canadian copyright legislation in 2012.\nThis book takes the very complicated legal framework that is the Canadian Copyright Act, explains it and makes it understandable to the layperson, providing concrete examples from case law to illustrate how the law has been interpreted. Surprisingly, it is quite readable and, at times, fascinating.\nThe book is divided into four main parts:\nPart I — Ideas, starts out with a description of why copyright came about, and examines the origin of the Canadian law by describing the evolution of the British, French and American concepts and how they influenced Canadian lawmakers. Part II — Law, looks at the scope of copyright (what is covered, and what is not) and contrasts owner’s rights with users’ rights. It also looks at copyright collectives representing authors and owners (such as Access Copyright) and goes into how copyright ownership of a work is determined and enforced. Part III — Practice, discusses particular nuances of copyright application, including music; digital media; film, video and photography; visual arts; craft and design; journalism; education; and libraries, archives and museums. Part IV — Contexts, looks at alternatives to copyright such as Indigenous Cultural Property concepts, the academic citation economy, the Open Source Knowledge movement and phenomena such as Creative Commons and GPL licenses. It also looks towards the future, predicting what may happen in the post-Bill C-11 world. For the first time, our common daily practice brings us into almost daily contact with copyright law—knowing both our rights and what we can and cannot do (and the reason why) matters to us more with each post.\nThis book explains complex copyright concepts in a very accessible manner. It should be required reading for librarians, educators and any Canadian who is interested in creator’s or user’s rights in a modern Internet-enabled world.\nRecommended?\rI highly recommend this very readable book."},"title":"Canadian copyright: A citizen's guide"},"/blog/cela-now-has-daisy-text-magazines/":{"data":{"how-to-download-and-read-them#How to download and read them":"This is a very exciting development, in my opinion. I do like to read magazines from time to time, but the ones that CELA offered frankly don’t interest me (apart from L’Actualité and, sometimes, MacLean’s magazine). The new offerings include WIRED magazine, though, which makes me really happy.\nWhat is a DAISY book?In case you don’t know, DAISY is an accessible format that allows visually-impaired people to navigate books, create bookmarks, and generally use a book the way a sighted person would, only by listening.\nDAISY is an international encoding standard which, hopefully, will one day merge with the new EPUB3 standard. If this happens – and the industry actually adopts that standard, another long story – then books will become accessible by default at the time of publication (a huge social-justice coup).\nUntil then, the DAISY Consortium makes tools available. It’s currently very difficult to make a DAISY book (but SO worth it from a visually-impaired reader’s point of view!). Trying to make one is one of the many things I have been frustrating myself with periodically in the past few years.\nBooks can be read by the computer (you have to develop an ear for this, it’s very confusing with homonyms, acronyms and words is doesn’t recognise being pronounced any old how) or they can be read out loud by actual people. This second type is much nicer to listen to, but also takes a lot longer to produce! It’s excellent for novels, short stories or any kind of fiction and the CNIB volunteers who read them are really heroes in my book.\nCELA has English and French volunteer-read books made by CNIB volunteers, but it also offers RNIB (UK), French and Australian readers. They recently made an agreement with Blackstone Audio, as well, I believe. Most of the books I review on this site are of the second variety.\nHow to find the new magazinesTo find CELA’s new DAISY text magazines, log in and select Newsstand. It is the second option on the Quick Links menu. This new offering greatly expands the number of accessible magazine title, and includes things like Wired magazine and The New Yorker.\nAccording to the website:\n“CELA, together with RB Digital, is launching Canada’s first DAISY magazine service to make some of today’s most popular magazines available in a wide range of formats as soon as they are published.\nThe growing collection will include numerous popular titles covering news and business, decorating and cooking, sports and health, hobbies and popular culture as well as teen’s, children’s and women’s magazines. By the end of 2017 CELA patrons will have access to more than 100 magazines.”\nCurrently (near the end of March, 2017), there are 10 English-language magazines available:\nAll the original audio magazines are still available, as well. Whereas the new magazines described above are read by a computer voice (text-to-speech or TTS), these are read by volunteers in a human voice. The audio magazine titles include MacLean’s, Canadian Geographic, Chatelaine, Good Times and Reader’s Digest in English, and l’Actualité, Bel Âge, Sélection du Reader’s Digest in French. There are also titles in Mandarin, Polish and Italian.\nHow to download and read them\rTo use these new magazines:\nWait. I digress. There are also a number of apps that you can use on Android and IOS, on your PC desktop or laptop, according to the website tutorials. Only, the Capti Reader is not available for Android (despite what the CELA site claims, it’s “coming soon”). I could not get it to work on my PC, either, since it uses Flash-based interface, of which many firewalls are suspicious (for good reason). Also, most functions are only available in the Premium (paid) version, including images and different playlists, etc.\nThe new magazines don’t seem to work on any of the apps I currently use.\nThere is an Android app called Direct to Player, which was created specifically to allow you to stream CELA books to your Android device. I tried for about an hour or so, but could not get it to recognise the DAISY text magazines. However, I do use this app quite a bit for the book content, and it works well. I use a similar app for Bookshare content Go Read by Benetech, which I love for my professional or other non-fiction reading. Unfortunately, Go Read does not seem to work, either. For Bookshare books, I mostly use the in-browser reader, though, because I read at lunch and my workplace will not allow me to install AMIS, my preferred desktop DAISY-reading tool. Problems\rOne problem that I did experience (and I’m not sure why): I downloaded the French AMIS language pack, and installed it. You have to restart, but that all went fine and the program came back up in French (yay) and could read its own help manual in French.\nWhat I could not get it to do, however, was to read the French magazine (Coup de pouce, avril 2017). I went back and tried with Les affaires : 4 mars 2017. Same issue: The Play button becomes the Pause button, and there is no way to unpause it!\nNow, I’m not sure if that is a CELA or an AMIS issue, but I supect it’s a CELA thing, since the Play button re-enables as soon as I close the French-language CELA DAISY book. Annoying. And, it means that I can’t review the French DAISY text magazines. Quel dommage.\nI’d be interested to hear if others have the same problem?\nUpdate: March 23, 2016 – App that will read the mazagines on Android\rI was able to hear the downloaded magazine using a DAISY Book Reader app from the Google Play store. It amazed me, really: I didn’t even try it – it just worked! I installed the app and it automatically recognised the magazines and started reading them! UNfortunately, it wouldn’t STOP reading them. I had to turn off the device! But that’s better than not being able to read them at all. They also have a non-advertising version for about 5 dollars. I don’t know if that one will stop or not (grin).\nUpdate: March 26, 2016 – More titles released (and still more scheduled)\rAs of today (March 26), there are currently 24 DAISY text magazines in English and 6 (1 more) in French. According to CELA, many more titles will be added. This is hugely exciting (to me, at least)! Certainly, something to keep your eye on.\nAlso, THERE IS NO TIME DELAY! April Wired was available yesterday! This is wonderful, as delays are often the norm for accessible publications.","how-to-find-the-new-magazines#How to find the new magazines":"","what-is-a-daisy-book#What is a DAISY book?":""},"title":"CELA now has DAISY text magazines"},"/blog/chief-inspector-barnaby-mysteries-by-caroline-graham/":{"data":{"about-the-book#About the book":"","about-the-story#About the story":"About the bookAuthor: Graham, Caroline, 1931-\nTitle: The killings at Badger’s Drift Publication: London : Headline Book Publishing, 1989.

They are pretty long, and not a lot happens until the end. It’s mainly character-driven with ongoing interpersonal plotlines among the principle characters, and a murder is done every show. By the end, the “bad guy” (or gal) has been apprehended, and lessons have been learnt all ‘round.\nUnsurprisingly, the books on which the series is based are pretty similar. The back-story is clearer in the books, though, and the characters are more fully developed. I can see a lot more in the TV show now that I have read the books. Subtle. The second one, in particular, is quite long to listen to. Interesting, but long.\nCELA has not digitised too many of her books, only two of them (number 2, A ghost in the machine, in English and in French translation) and number 4, Written in blood (DA31506). The Toronto Public Library has the first one, The killings at Badger’s Drift, as well as the two that CELA has.\nIf you have not seen the show, Inspector Barnaby lives in a small village in the fictitious English countryside of Midsomer, where he and an ambitious, conceited, n’er-do-well Sergent solve a series of improbable murders in picturesque settings. Village characters abound, each a less likely suspect than the last until at last Barnaby reveals whodunit. The humour is dry and the pints are legion. Makes me long for good English Real Ale, sadly lacking on this side of the pond.\nIn Badger’s Drift, an eccentric old lady insists on the investigation of the sudden, unexpected death of her best friend, a spinster living in the village of Badger’s Drift. It turns out the deceased saw something she should never have seen…\nIn Ghost, Dennis Brinkely, a beloved resident of the tiny hamlet of Forbes Abbot, is found slain amidst his horrifying collection of medieval torture devices. The only witness, Benny Fraye, is unreliable in many respects. The supernatural is consulted (albeit not by the constabulary) and the waters are muddied. If you like a good, convoluted plot, Ghost is for you.\nRecommended?\rI like them, they are long and involved and pretty easy-listening. I watch the TV series sometimes, but put a few weeks between them so they don’t get tiresome."},"title":"Chief Inspector Barnaby mysteries by Caroline Graham"},"/blog/cool-water-by-dianne-warren/":{"data":{"about-the-book#About the book":"","about-the-story#About the story":"About the bookAuthor: Warren, Dianne, 1950-\nTitle: Cool water by Dianne Warren\nPublication: Toronto : HarperCollins Canada, 2009.

Most of the stories are set in the modern era, but the past does creep in — linked by memory, relationships and places. They are stories of love, loss, happiness, sadness, teenaged angst and despair. There are horses, camels, exploding rocks and a silver tea service.\nIt’s not a fast-moving story, it sort of meanders around like a brook. Characters appear and wander off, unrelated stories follow one another until the author’s portraits have depth, breadth and complexity.\nKathleen Miller, who reads the stories, lets the book’s leisurely rhythm guide her. She does a really good job. I didn’t know what to expect, but I enjoyed the book more the longer I listened.\nThis book won the Governor General’s award for fiction in 2010.\nRecommended?\rA slow read for both lovers of short stories and of longer fiction, provided they are not put off by rapid changes of scenery and character."},"title":"Cool water by Dianne Warren"},"/blog/crosstalk-by-connie-willis/":{"data":{"about-the-book#About the book":"","about-the-story#About the story":"About the bookAuthor: Willis, Connie.\nTitle: Crosstalk.\nPublication: New York : Del Rey, [2016].

CELA library call number DA52655. 498 pages in the paper edition; 18 hrs., 45 mins. as a recorded book.\nAbout the story\rThis book follows the adventures of young Briddey Flanagan, an Irish-American woman living in a modern day where doctors have the ability to surgically increase empathy between romantic partners. Leaping at the chance to become linked to her fiancé Trent, a gorgeous young executive rocketing up the corporate ladder in her communications firm, Briddey has the surgery.\nOnly, things do not go quite as she had expected… The audiobook has a lovely narration by Mia Barron, whom I have heard before.\nThis is the latest book (2016) by Connie Willis, whom I consider one of the most readable speculative fiction writers out there. Her quirky sense of humour and her masterful ability to imagine “what would happen if…?” make her one of my very favourite authors. She has won numerous awards (and very deservedly so, may I say?).\nSadly, the CELA library only has four of her books. Public libraries often have them in audiobook (CDs) or e-audiobook (downloadable through OverDrive) formats, however, which is how I listened to most of the ones I could access. (Thank you, Toronto Public Library!)\nThe first time I encountered her was in the BRILLIANT book To say nothing of the dog, or, How we found the Bishop’s bird stump at last. Set in a world where historians travel to various eras for research, this one features the Victorian era. I was blown away by how out-and-out hilarious this book was, and how complex and believable the plot was. I was hooked. CELA has this book, narrated by David Cutler (DA21993).\nSlightly darker is her Blackout and All clear series, which CELA does not have. Set in WWII England, the time-travelling historians become embroiled in the war, its aftermath and its dangers. Compelling and readable, the historical detail is impressive and heart-wrenching.\nBellwether (CELA DA22417, narrated by Melanie Ray) is about advertising, chaos theory and – you guessed it – sheep. It’s a love story.\nThe last one CELA has, Impossible things (DA20231), is a collection of short stories I am saving for when I really need cheering up. I am looking forward to it!\nBookshare, of course, has everything! You need access to a DAISY player, and the ability to listen to a machine voice for a long time.\nRecommended?\rI love this author and recommend them all highly."},"title":"Crosstalk by Connie Willis"},"/blog/easy-3d-printing-of-braille/":{"data":{"wherein-i-digress#Wherein I digress":"Wherein I digressTaking a break from the usual book review, I thought I would talk about something cool that turned out to be very easy, thanks to my local library.\nI was talking to my instructor at the wonderful Hadley School for the Blind, a correspondence school for blind people and those with low-vision (and their families). We were discussing clothing markers, which are attached to hangers and used to distinguish colours (blue, black, brown, etc.) when you can’t see them. There are various ways of doing this, using raised markers on paper or plastic tags, using Braille on tags, and there are several commercial solutions out there for this, as well.\nSomething I have been thinking about as a librarian is the 3D printer revolution that is happening in libraries across Canada and around the world.\nAn aside:\nSeriously, check out your local public library to see if they have a 3D printer in their \"maker space\" or \"innovation lab\". They are often inexpensive ways of making things like art or replacement parts for that pesky stroller thingy.\rIf your library doesn't have some a) ask them to get one (they just might, unless they are being bled a slow budgetary death, which many are) or b) ask around your community to see if there is a hack lab nearby. These are places where interested members come together, usually on a Tuesday, to make stuff and help each other learn new skills.\rAnyway, the conjunction of these two thoughts led me to think that 3D printing Braille clothing tags was a (nearly) obvious solution.\nTwo problems: I don’t read Braille (yet, though I am learning) and all I knew about 3D printing was that it’s a thing. So, what’s to do? Ask the Internet, of course.\nThe answer, of course, is on GitHub, where user v01pe posted a tool to generate text to 3D printable Braille. How awesome is that? It’s an online tool – in German – that creates a downloadable file for a 3D printer.\nSo, I input my text and kept contracted Braille, the default, selected. I waited for a while, about a minute or so, and there was a downloadable STL file. I put it on a thumb drive and beetled off to the maker space in my public library.\nThe guy who worked there said the files were fine and ready to use. He set them up for me, trying various configurations to shorten the printing time (I was printing two of them at once), and let me choose a bright red plastic to print them in.\nA couple of hours later, and I had printed Braille! [S]ee very short video.](https://youtu.be/7SZFlv8hcZc)\nI snapped off the extra printed base (you can see it on the printer shot, above) from one of them, but left the base on the other one so it could stand up.\nIt was fun and easy and made me feel clever, which doesn’t always happen a lot. 🙂 Even better: the plastic they use is biodegradable, although chemically stable for a number of years.\nClever AND virtuous.\nNow, for it to be useful for my original purpose – clothing markers – I would need to learn a bit more: how to extend the piece and add a little hole to put the hanger’s head through.

He sees this starting at a young age, after the mastery of the basic literacies in school, and continuing to develop and deepen throughout life. He also discusses interdisciplinary learning, where mastery in more than one domain is acquired, and where the two or more domains inform the decisions and practice of the individual.\nThe disciplined mind, he explains, is a pre-requisite for the synthesising mind, a mind which can take in and organise the massive amounts of information we are faced with and then explain it in such a way that others can understand it. Synthesising ability develops from early attempts to explain what has been taught, through literature or field-of-study reviews at school or in the workplace, and ideally leading to sophisticated gathering and condensing of information in both personal and professional life. The synthesising mind understands the details but focuses on and explains the bigger picture as a whole. He distinguishes this ability from that of the creative mind, which takes the mastery of existing concepts and extends them to uncover a new concept, create a novel product or devise an effective solution. Before it can be creative, he tells us, the mind must be both disciplined and be able to synthesise. He imagines these three minds as interconnected, building upon each other.\nNext, the respectful mind, approaches different people, perspectives and cultures with more than just curiosity or tolerance, but with genuine respect. This, he posits, is necessary for our very survival, and will become increasingly important as communication between different counties and cultures becomes faster and easier. He intends the term to cover inter-racial and inter-cultural relationships, as well as relationships among people from the same society or organisation who occupy different positions in the hierarchy: respect for one’s superiors and inferiors, as well as for one’s peers and neighbours.\nFinally, the ethical mind is possessed by one who understands her or his responsibilities—both as a member of a profession and as a member of society—and who strives to fulfill them. Being ethical involves understanding what it right and using those principles guide your actions and decisions, rather than letting things like personal gain or pride derail you from the ethical path.\nGardner clearly explains the reasons he considers each of these cognitive abilities to be essential, and illustrates each section with both positive and negative examples of the qualities he describes.\nThis book, which originally appeared in 2007, is largely based on his previous work, Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983). He goes on to explore some of the “minds” in greater depth in later publications.\nI thought the book was well-written and engaging, though perhaps a bit prescriptive. It was clearly written to help teachers guide “future leaders” into specific habits of mind, and to instruct employers on what to look for in future employees (or to remediate in existing ones). The book was well-structured, following the time-honoured “say it, explain it, say it again” formula that is so essential for learning and teaching.\nOverall, his approach provides a useful perspective for someone who is either teaching others or continuing their own education, because it breaks down professional learning and behaviour into novel categories and encourages readers to think about their own practice in relation to them.\nRecommended?\rInteresting.

CELA library call number DA480602007. 417 pages in the paperback edition, 11 hrs., 26 min. as a recorded book.\nAbout the story\rAfter suffering a tragic loss, a Dorsetshire family moves to Georgian-era London at the invitation of a circus owner. Setting up a chair-making workshop in their small upstairs apartment, the Kellaway family set about making a new life for themselves, encountering colourful neighbours such as the publisher and artist William Blake, the streetwise Maggie Butterfield and the mesmerising circus owner Philip Astley.\nThe author paints a vivid picture of life in the early 1790s, with lots of well-researched detail and an engaging plot. There are several strands to the story, which mostly follows young Jem Kellaway’s adventures through the streets of London with Maggie and tells the story of his sister, Maisie.\nThe story is interesting and well written. The descriptions of the time and the setting are memorable, and it feels like the book ends just a bit too soon. Jill Tanner’s narration is well done, and she is very pleasant to listen to, in my opinion.\nRecommended?\rThis is a very readable story with both male and female protagonists."},"title":"Burning Bright by Tracy Chevalier"},"/canadian-copyright-a-citizens-guide-by-laura-murray/":{"data":{"about-the-book#About the book":"","about-the-book-1#About the book":"About the bookAuthor: Murray, Laura J. with Samuel E. Trosow\nTitle: Canadian copyright: A citizen’s guide. (2nd edition)\nPublication: Toronto : Between the Lines, 2013. ISBN 9781771130134.\nAbout the book\rI initially read the first edition of this book in 2007. I was struck by how clearly the authors explained the history of copyright in Canada. They clearly demonstrate how that history informs Canadian law, and how the law informs the practice of individuals and groups across our society.\nIronically, it is often much easier for Canadians to be informed about “fair use” (an American copyright principle, as opposed to “fair dealing”, used in Canada) and the DMCA than it is to know about the laws that govern our daily practice here in Canada. This book goes a long way towards addressing this lack of understandable information in Canada.\nThis second edition has been revised and expanded to include the many changes brought about by [Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act]{http://copyright.ubc.ca/copyright-legislation/bill-c-11-the-copyright-modernization-act/), which amended Canadian copyright legislation in 2012.\nThis book takes the very complicated legal framework that is the Canadian Copyright Act, explains it and makes it understandable to the layperson, providing concrete examples from case law to illustrate how the law has been interpreted. Surprisingly, it is quite readable and, at times, fascinating.\nThe book is divided into four main parts:\nPart I — Ideas, starts out with a description of why copyright came about, and examines the origin of the Canadian law by describing the evolution of the British, French and American concepts and how they influenced Canadian lawmakers. Part II — Law, looks at the scope of copyright (what is covered, and what is not) and contrasts owner’s rights with users’ rights. It also looks at copyright collectives representing authors and owners (such as Access Copyright) and goes into how copyright ownership of a work is determined and enforced. Part III — Practice, discusses particular nuances of copyright application, including music; digital media; film, video and photography; visual arts; craft and design; journalism; education; and libraries, archives and museums. Part IV — Contexts, looks at alternatives to copyright such as Indigenous Cultural Property concepts, the academic citation economy, the Open Source Knowledge movement and phenomena such as Creative Commons and GPL licenses. It also looks towards the future, predicting what may happen in the post-Bill C-11 world. For the first time, our common daily practice brings us into almost daily contact with copyright law—knowing both our rights and what we can and cannot do (and the reason why) matters to us more with each post.\nThis book explains complex copyright concepts in a very accessible manner. It should be required reading for librarians, educators and any Canadian who is interested in creator’s or user’s rights in a modern Internet-enabled world.\nRecommended?\rI highly recommend this very readable book."},"title":"Canadian copyright: A citizen's guide"},"/cela-now-has-daisy-text-magazines/":{"data":{"how-to-download-and-read-them#How to download and read them":"This is a very exciting development, in my opinion. I do like to read magazines from time to time, but the ones that CELA offered frankly don’t interest me (apart from L’Actualité and, sometimes, MacLean’s magazine). The new offerings include WIRED magazine, though, which makes me really happy.\nWhat is a DAISY book?In case you don’t know, DAISY is an accessible format that allows visually-impaired people to navigate books, create bookmarks, and generally use a book the way a sighted person would, only by listening.\nDAISY is an international encoding standard which, hopefully, will one day merge with the new EPUB3 standard. If this happens – and the industry actually adopts that standard, another long story – then books will become accessible by default at the time of publication (a huge social-justice coup).\nUntil then, the DAISY Consortium makes tools available. It’s currently very difficult to make a DAISY book (but SO worth it from a visually-impaired reader’s point of view!). Trying to make one is one of the many things I have been frustrating myself with periodically in the past few years.\nBooks can be read by the computer (you have to develop an ear for this, it’s very confusing with homonyms, acronyms and words is doesn’t recognise being pronounced any old how) or they can be read out loud by actual people. This second type is much nicer to listen to, but also takes a lot longer to produce! It’s excellent for novels, short stories or any kind of fiction and the CNIB volunteers who read them are really heroes in my book.\nCELA has English and French volunteer-read books made by CNIB volunteers, but it also offers RNIB (UK), French and Australian readers. They recently made an agreement with Blackstone Audio, as well, I believe. Most of the books I review on this site are of the second variety.\nHow to find the new magazinesTo find CELA’s new DAISY text magazines, log in and select Newsstand. It is the second option on the Quick Links menu. This new offering greatly expands the number of accessible magazine title, and includes things like Wired magazine and The New Yorker.\nAccording to the website:\n“CELA, together with RB Digital, is launching Canada’s first DAISY magazine service to make some of today’s most popular magazines available in a wide range of formats as soon as they are published.\nThe growing collection will include numerous popular titles covering news and business, decorating and cooking, sports and health, hobbies and popular culture as well as teen’s, children’s and women’s magazines. By the end of 2017 CELA patrons will have access to more than 100 magazines.”\nCurrently (near the end of March, 2017), there are 10 English-language magazines available:\nAll the original audio magazines are still available, as well. Whereas the new magazines described above are read by a computer voice (text-to-speech or TTS), these are read by volunteers in a human voice. The audio magazine titles include MacLean’s, Canadian Geographic, Chatelaine, Good Times and Reader’s Digest in English, and l’Actualité, Bel Âge, Sélection du Reader’s Digest in French. There are also titles in Mandarin, Polish and Italian.\nHow to download and read them\rTo use these new magazines:\nWait. I digress. There are also a number of apps that you can use on Android and IOS, on your PC desktop or laptop, according to the website tutorials. Only, the Capti Reader is not available for Android (despite what the CELA site claims, it’s “coming soon”). I could not get it to work on my PC, either, since it uses Flash-based interface, of which many firewalls are suspicious (for good reason). Also, most functions are only available in the Premium (paid) version, including images and different playlists, etc.\nThe new magazines don’t seem to work on any of the apps I currently use.\nThere is an Android app called Direct to Player, which was created specifically to allow you to stream CELA books to your Android device. I tried for about an hour or so, but could not get it to recognise the DAISY text magazines. However, I do use this app quite a bit for the book content, and it works well. I use a similar app for Bookshare content Go Read by Benetech, which I love for my professional or other non-fiction reading. Unfortunately, Go Read does not seem to work, either. For Bookshare books, I mostly use the in-browser reader, though, because I read at lunch and my workplace will not allow me to install AMIS, my preferred desktop DAISY-reading tool. Problems\rOne problem that I did experience (and I’m not sure why): I downloaded the French AMIS language pack, and installed it. You have to restart, but that all went fine and the program came back up in French (yay) and could read its own help manual in French.\nWhat I could not get it to do, however, was to read the French magazine (Coup de pouce, avril 2017). I went back and tried with Les affaires : 4 mars 2017. Same issue: The Play button becomes the Pause button, and there is no way to unpause it!\nNow, I’m not sure if that is a CELA or an AMIS issue, but I supect it’s a CELA thing, since the Play button re-enables as soon as I close the French-language CELA DAISY book. Annoying. And, it means that I can’t review the French DAISY text magazines. Quel dommage.\nI’d be interested to hear if others have the same problem?\nUpdate: March 23, 2016 – App that will read the mazagines on Android\rI was able to hear the downloaded magazine using a DAISY Book Reader app from the Google Play store. It amazed me, really: I didn’t even try it – it just worked! I installed the app and it automatically recognised the magazines and started reading them! UNfortunately, it wouldn’t STOP reading them. I had to turn off the device! But that’s better than not being able to read them at all. They also have a non-advertising version for about 5 dollars. I don’t know if that one will stop or not (grin).\nUpdate: March 26, 2016 – More titles released (and still more scheduled)\rAs of today (March 26), there are currently 24 DAISY text magazines in English and 6 (1 more) in French. According to CELA, many more titles will be added. This is hugely exciting (to me, at least)! Certainly, something to keep your eye on.\nAlso, THERE IS NO TIME DELAY! April Wired was available yesterday! This is wonderful, as delays are often the norm for accessible publications.","how-to-find-the-new-magazines#How to find the new magazines":"","what-is-a-daisy-book#What is a DAISY book?":""},"title":"CELA now has DAISY text magazines"},"/chief-inspector-barnaby-mysteries-by-caroline-graham/":{"data":{"about-the-book#About the book":"","about-the-story#About the story":"About the bookAuthor: Graham, Caroline, 1931-\nTitle: The killings at Badger’s Drift Publication: London : Headline Book Publishing, 1989.

They are pretty long, and not a lot happens until the end. It’s mainly character-driven with ongoing interpersonal plotlines among the principle characters, and a murder is done every show. By the end, the “bad guy” (or gal) has been apprehended, and lessons have been learnt all ‘round.\nUnsurprisingly, the books on which the series is based are pretty similar. The back-story is clearer in the books, though, and the characters are more fully developed. I can see a lot more in the TV show now that I have read the books. Subtle. The second one, in particular, is quite long to listen to. Interesting, but long.\nCELA has not digitised too many of her books, only two of them (number 2, A ghost in the machine, in English and in French translation) and number 4, Written in blood (DA31506). The Toronto Public Library has the first one, The killings at Badger’s Drift, as well as the two that CELA has.\nIf you have not seen the show, Inspector Barnaby lives in a small village in the fictitious English countryside of Midsomer, where he and an ambitious, conceited, n’er-do-well Sergent solve a series of improbable murders in picturesque settings. Village characters abound, each a less likely suspect than the last until at last Barnaby reveals whodunit. The humour is dry and the pints are legion. Makes me long for good English Real Ale, sadly lacking on this side of the pond.\nIn Badger’s Drift, an eccentric old lady insists on the investigation of the sudden, unexpected death of her best friend, a spinster living in the village of Badger’s Drift. It turns out the deceased saw something she should never have seen…\nIn Ghost, Dennis Brinkely, a beloved resident of the tiny hamlet of Forbes Abbot, is found slain amidst his horrifying collection of medieval torture devices. The only witness, Benny Fraye, is unreliable in many respects. The supernatural is consulted (albeit not by the constabulary) and the waters are muddied. If you like a good, convoluted plot, Ghost is for you.\nRecommended?\rI like them, they are long and involved and pretty easy-listening.

Most of the stories are set in the modern era, but the past does creep in — linked by memory, relationships and places. They are stories of love, loss, happiness, sadness, teenaged angst and despair. There are horses, camels, exploding rocks and a silver tea service.\nIt’s not a fast-moving story, it sort of meanders around like a brook. Characters appear and wander off, unrelated stories follow one another until the author’s portraits have depth, breadth and complexity.\nKathleen Miller, who reads the stories, lets the book’s leisurely rhythm guide her.

Leaping at the chance to become linked to her fiancé Trent, a gorgeous young executive rocketing up the corporate ladder in her communications firm, Briddey has the surgery.\nOnly, things do not go quite as she had expected… The audiobook has a lovely narration by Mia Barron, whom I have heard before.\nThis is the latest book (2016) by Connie Willis, whom I consider one of the most readable speculative fiction writers out there. Her quirky sense of humour and her masterful ability to imagine “what would happen if…?” make her one of my very favourite authors. She has won numerous awards (and very deservedly so, may I say?).\nSadly, the CELA library only has four of her books. Public libraries often have them in audiobook (CDs) or e-audiobook (downloadable through OverDrive) formats, however, which is how I listened to most of the ones I could access. (Thank you, Toronto Public Library!)\nThe first time I encountered her was in the BRILLIANT book To say nothing of the dog, or, How we found the Bishop’s bird stump at last. Set in a world where historians travel to various eras for research, this one features the Victorian era. I was blown away by how out-and-out hilarious this book was, and how complex and believable the plot was. I was hooked. CELA has this book, narrated by David Cutler (DA21993).\nSlightly darker is her Blackout and All clear series, which CELA does not have. Set in WWII England, the time-travelling historians become embroiled in the war, its aftermath and its dangers. Compelling and readable, the historical detail is impressive and heart-wrenching.\nBellwether (CELA DA22417, narrated by Melanie Ray) is about advertising, chaos theory and – you guessed it – sheep. It’s a love story.\nThe last one CELA has, Impossible things (DA20231), is a collection of short stories I am saving for when I really need cheering up. I am looking forward to it!\nBookshare, of course, has everything! You need access to a DAISY player, and the ability to listen to a machine voice for a long time.\nRecommended?\rI love this author and recommend them all highly."},"title":"Crosstalk by Connie Willis"},"/easy-3d-printing-of-braille/":{"data":{"wherein-i-digress#Wherein I digress":"Wherein I digressTaking a break from the usual book review, I thought I would talk about something cool that turned out to be very easy, thanks to my local library.\nI was talking to my instructor at the wonderful Hadley School for the Blind, a correspondence school for blind people and those with low-vision (and their families). We were discussing clothing markers, which are attached to hangers and used to distinguish colours (blue, black, brown, etc.) when you can’t see them. There are various ways of doing this, using raised markers on paper or plastic tags, using Braille on tags, and there are several commercial solutions out there for this, as well.\nSomething I have been thinking about as a librarian is the 3D printer revolution that is happening in libraries across Canada and around the world.\nAn aside:\nSeriously, check out your local public library to see if they have a 3D printer in their \"maker space\" or \"innovation lab\". They are often inexpensive ways of making things like art or replacement parts for that pesky stroller thingy.\rIf your library doesn't have some a) ask them to get one (they just might, unless they are being bled a slow budgetary death, which many are) or b) ask around your community to see if there is a hack lab nearby. These are places where interested members come together, usually on a Tuesday, to make stuff and help each other learn new skills.\rAnyway, the conjunction of these two thoughts led me to think that 3D printing Braille clothing tags was a (nearly) obvious solution.\nTwo problems: I don’t read Braille (yet, though I am learning) and all I knew about 3D printing was that it’s a thing. So, what’s to do? Ask the Internet, of course.\nThe answer, of course, is on GitHub, where user v01pe posted a tool to generate text to 3D printable Braille. How awesome is that? It’s an online tool – in German – that creates a downloadable file for a 3D printer.\nSo, I input my text and kept contracted Braille, the default, selected. I waited for a while, about a minute or so, and there was a downloadable STL file. I put it on a thumb drive and beetled off to the maker space in my public library.\nThe guy who worked there said the files were fine and ready to use. He set them up for me, trying various configurations to shorten the printing time (I was printing two of them at once), and let me choose a bright red plastic to print them in.\nA couple of hours later, and I had printed Braille! [S]ee very short video.](https://youtu.be/7SZFlv8hcZc)\nI snapped off the extra printed base (you can see it on the printer shot, above) from one of them, but left the base on the other one so it could stand up.\nIt was fun and easy and made me feel clever, which doesn’t always happen a lot. 🙂 Even better: the plastic they use is biodegradable, although chemically stable for a number of years.\nClever AND virtuous.\nNow, for it to be useful for my original purpose – clothing markers – I would need to learn a bit more: how to extend the piece and add a little hole to put the hanger’s head through. The library offers “3D printer certification” workshops, where they teach you the software and how to use it.

No, wait! Keep reading! Not those kinds of vampires… well, yes, those kind, but you hardly notice, really.\nI know, it sounds very cheesy but Deborah E. Harkness is an historian: the research into the time periods was done right and she writes very well. It’s very readable, and there is a tolerable amount of sex (in most vampire tales, the sex comprises most of the story and grammar is often eschewed). There is sex in a NSFW context, but not enough to leave you blushing uncontrollably as it’s read out loud to you.\nSo, starting over: This is a trilogy that involves vampires and time travel. And witches. And a magic house. Hmm.\nStarting over: In A discovery of witches fictional historian Diana Bishop is researching her topic on the history of science in the Bodleian library at Oxford, when she comes across an unusual manuscript, one that has been lost for hundreds of years. Magically hidden in the special collections, Diana’s reading of the book sets in motion a maze of occult happenings. Coming as she does from a long line of New England witches, Diana is aware of the book’s power and sends it back straightaway. But, it’s too late. Weird stuff happens.\nThe second book, Shadow of night, is mostly set in the England of the 1590s. Diana’s love Matthew reclaims his identity as a poet and spy and member of the School of the Night, a secret society of learning that runs counter to the religious zeitgeist of the times. All very cloak and dagger.\nThe third and final book, The book of life, returns to present day and to the mysterious Ashmole 782 manuscript — specifically, to the missing pages thereof. The alchemical flavours underlying the previous two books are thrust to the fore and the imagery and its significance play a huge role in the story.\nThe books are each read by different narrators, which slows down the re-integration of the story if, like me, you read the books over a broad-ish period of time. Despite that, this is an excellent series that is good fun and mentally engaging to read. Or, I’m a sucker for period fiction (which is also true). I like the characters, I like the plots – which never seem overly long – and I like the way the story unfolds over several time periods.\nRecommended?\rGood for people who enjoy supernatural or historical fiction."},"title":"A discovery of witches by Deborah E.
