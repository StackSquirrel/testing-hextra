        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Willis, Connie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: New York : Del Rey, [2016]. ISBN 9780345540676.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Mia Barron. CELA library call number DA52655. 498 pages in the paper edition; 18 hrs., 45 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book follows the adventures of young Briddey Flanagan, an Irish-American woman living in a modern day where doctors have the ability to surgically increase empathy between romantic partners. Leaping at the chance to become linked to her fiancé Trent, a gorgeous young executive rocketing up the corporate ladder in her communications firm, Briddey has the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only, things do not go quite as she had expected&amp;hellip; The audiobook has a lovely narration by Mia Barron, whom I have heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the latest book (2016) by Connie Willis, whom I consider one of the most readable speculative fiction writers out there. Her quirky sense of humour and her masterful ability to imagine &amp;ldquo;what would happen if&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo; make her one of my very favourite authors. She has won numerous awards (and very deservedly so, may I say?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the CELA library only has four of her books. Public libraries often have them in audiobook (CDs) or e-audiobook (downloadable through OverDrive) formats, however, which is how I listened to most of the ones I could access. (Thank you, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?N=37920&amp;amp;amp;Ns=p_pub_date_sort&amp;amp;amp;Nso=1&amp;amp;amp;Ntt=willis%2C&amp;#43;connie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Toronto Public Library&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I encountered her was in the BRILLIANT book &lt;strong&gt;To say nothing of the dog, or, How we found the Bishop&amp;rsquo;s bird stump at last&lt;/strong&gt;. Set in a world where historians travel to various eras for research, this one features the Victorian era. I was blown away by how out-and-out hilarious this book was, and how complex and believable the plot was. I was hooked. CELA has this book, narrated by David Cutler (DA21993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly darker is her &lt;strong&gt;Blackout&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;All clear&lt;/strong&gt; series, which CELA does not have. Set in WWII England, the time-travelling historians become embroiled in the war, its aftermath and its dangers. Compelling and readable, the historical detail is impressive and heart-wrenching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bellwether&lt;/strong&gt; (CELA DA22417, narrated by Melanie Ray) is about advertising, chaos theory and &amp;ndash; you guessed it &amp;ndash; sheep. It&amp;rsquo;s a love story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one CELA has, &lt;strong&gt;Impossible things&lt;/strong&gt; (DA20231), is a collection of short stories I am saving for when I really need cheering up. I am looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bookshare.org/search?keyword=willis%2C&amp;#43;connie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bookshare&lt;/a&gt;, of course, has everything! You need access to a DAISY player, and the ability to listen to a machine voice for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this author and recommend them all highly.&lt;/p&gt;
