        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Harkness, Deborah E., 1965-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: A discovery of witches; Series: All souls trilogy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A discovery of witches&lt;/strong&gt; (DA41609, ISBN9780670022410), 2011, read by Imogen Church (579 pages ; 25 hours, 31 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow of the night&lt;/strong&gt; (DA45810, ISBN9780670023486), 2012, read by  Karina Fernandez (584 pages ; 25 hours, 22 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book of life&lt;/strong&gt; (DA49922, ISBN9780670025596 ), 2014, read by Jennifer Ikeda (561 pages; 23 hours, 55 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: New York : Viking, 2011, 2012 &amp;amp; 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a trilogy that involves vampires and time travel. No, wait! Keep reading! Not those kinds of vampires&amp;hellip; well, yes, those kind, but you hardly notice, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it sounds very cheesy but Deborah E. Harkness is an historian: the research into the time periods was done right and she writes very well. It&amp;rsquo;s very readable, and there is a tolerable amount of sex (in most vampire tales, the sex comprises most of the story and grammar is often eschewed). There is sex in a NSFW context, but not enough to leave you blushing uncontrollably as it&amp;rsquo;s read out loud to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, starting over: This is a trilogy that involves vampires and time travel. And witches. And a magic house. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting over: In &lt;em&gt;A discovery of witches&lt;/em&gt; fictional historian Diana Bishop is researching her topic on the history of science in the Bodleian library at Oxford, when she comes across an unusual manuscript, one that has been lost for hundreds of years. Magically hidden in the special collections, Diana&amp;rsquo;s reading of the book sets in motion a maze of occult happenings. Coming as she does from a long line of New England witches, Diana is aware of the book&amp;rsquo;s power and sends it back straightaway. But, it&amp;rsquo;s too late. Weird stuff happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of night&lt;/em&gt;, is mostly set in the England of the 1590s. Diana&amp;rsquo;s love Matthew reclaims his identity as a poet and spy and member of the School of the Night, a secret society of learning that runs counter to the religious zeitgeist of the times. All very cloak and dagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final book, &lt;em&gt;The book of life&lt;/em&gt;, returns to present day and to the mysterious Ashmole 782 manuscript — specifically, to the missing pages thereof. The alchemical flavours underlying the previous two books are thrust to the fore and the imagery and its significance play a huge role in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books are each read by different narrators, which slows down the re-integration of the story if, like me, you read the books over a broad-ish period of time. Despite that, this is an excellent series that is good fun and mentally engaging to read. Or, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for period fiction (which is also true). I like the characters, I like the plots &amp;ndash; which never seem overly long &amp;ndash; and I like the way the story unfolds over several time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good for people who enjoy supernatural or historical fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk by Connie Willis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/crosstalk-by-connie-willis/</link>

        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Willis, Connie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: New York : Del Rey, [2016]. ISBN 9780345540676.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Mia Barron. CELA library call number DA52655. 498 pages in the paper edition; 18 hrs., 45 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book follows the adventures of young Briddey Flanagan, an Irish-American woman living in a modern day where doctors have the ability to surgically increase empathy between romantic partners. Leaping at the chance to become linked to her fiancé Trent, a gorgeous young executive rocketing up the corporate ladder in her communications firm, Briddey has the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only, things do not go quite as she had expected&amp;hellip; The audiobook has a lovely narration by Mia Barron, whom I have heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the latest book (2016) by Connie Willis, whom I consider one of the most readable speculative fiction writers out there. Her quirky sense of humour and her masterful ability to imagine &amp;ldquo;what would happen if&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo; make her one of my very favourite authors. She has won numerous awards (and very deservedly so, may I say?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the CELA library only has four of her books. Public libraries often have them in audiobook (CDs) or e-audiobook (downloadable through OverDrive) formats, however, which is how I listened to most of the ones I could access. (Thank you, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?N=37920&amp;amp;amp;Ns=p_pub_date_sort&amp;amp;amp;Nso=1&amp;amp;amp;Ntt=willis%2C&amp;#43;connie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Toronto Public Library&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I encountered her was in the BRILLIANT book &lt;strong&gt;To say nothing of the dog, or, How we found the Bishop&amp;rsquo;s bird stump at last&lt;/strong&gt;. Set in a world where historians travel to various eras for research, this one features the Victorian era. I was blown away by how out-and-out hilarious this book was, and how complex and believable the plot was. I was hooked. CELA has this book, narrated by David Cutler (DA21993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly darker is her &lt;strong&gt;Blackout&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;All clear&lt;/strong&gt; series, which CELA does not have. Set in WWII England, the time-travelling historians become embroiled in the war, its aftermath and its dangers. Compelling and readable, the historical detail is impressive and heart-wrenching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bellwether&lt;/strong&gt; (CELA DA22417, narrated by Melanie Ray) is about advertising, chaos theory and &amp;ndash; you guessed it &amp;ndash; sheep. It&amp;rsquo;s a love story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one CELA has, &lt;strong&gt;Impossible things&lt;/strong&gt; (DA20231), is a collection of short stories I am saving for when I really need cheering up. I am looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bookshare.org/search?keyword=willis%2C&amp;#43;connie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bookshare&lt;/a&gt;, of course, has everything! You need access to a DAISY player, and the ability to listen to a machine voice for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this author and recommend them all highly.&lt;/p&gt;
