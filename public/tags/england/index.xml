&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: A ghost in the machine.
&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: London : Headline, 2004. ISBN 0755307704.
DAISY audio format narrated by Terri Cherniak. CELA library call number DA26166. 375 pages in the paper edition; 19 hrs., 30 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have probably seen the &lt;strong&gt;Midsomer Murders&lt;/strong&gt; show on TV (TV Ontario has been running it in segments for decades) or on a streaming service like Netflix. They are pretty long, and not a lot happens until the end. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly character-driven with ongoing interpersonal plotlines among the principle characters, and a murder is done every show. By the end, the &amp;ldquo;bad guy&amp;rdquo; (or gal) has been apprehended, and lessons have been learnt all &amp;lsquo;round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the books on which the series is based are pretty similar. The back-story is clearer in the books, though, and the characters are more fully developed. I can see a lot more in the TV show now that I have read the books. Subtle. The second one, in particular, is quite long to listen to. Interesting, but long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CELA has not digitised too many of her books, only two of them (number 2, A ghost in the machine, in English and in French translation) and number 4, Written in blood (DA31506). The Toronto Public Library has the first one, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM3522999&amp;amp;amp;R=3522999&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The killings at Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the two that CELA has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not seen the show, Inspector Barnaby lives in a small village in the fictitious English countryside of Midsomer, where he and an ambitious, conceited, n&amp;rsquo;er-do-well Sergent solve a series of improbable murders in picturesque settings. Village characters abound, each a less likely suspect than the last until at last Barnaby reveals whodunit. The humour is dry and the pints are legion. Makes me long for good English Real Ale, sadly lacking on this side of the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift&lt;/em&gt;, an eccentric old lady insists on the investigation of the sudden, unexpected death of her best friend, a spinster living in the village of Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift. It turns out the deceased saw something she should never have seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt;, Dennis Brinkely, a beloved resident of the tiny hamlet of Forbes Abbot, is found slain amidst his horrifying collection of medieval torture devices. The only witness, Benny Fraye, is unreliable in many respects. The supernatural is consulted (albeit not by the constabulary) and the waters are muddied. If you like a good, convoluted plot, &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt; is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like them, they are long and involved and pretty easy-listening. I watch the TV series sometimes, but put a few weeks between them so they don&amp;rsquo;t get tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The American boy by Andrew Taylor</title>

        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Taylor, Andrew (1951- ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: The American boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: London : Flamingo, 2003. ISBN 000710961X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Alex Jennings. CELA library call number DA29862. 400 pages in paper format;Â 16 hrs.,Â 45 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar Allan Poe is the eponymous American Boy, but he is really a secondary character in the novel. He ties the actors together, but he does not play a crucial role by his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in 1819, the story follows Thomas Sheild as, newly recovered from battlefield injuries, he sets out to begin a career as Master at a boys&amp;rsquo; school outside of London. He becomes involved in a murder, and in various intrigues. He falls in love with the wrong woman, and does his best to maintain his integrity. A lot of Victorian social mores come into play. There is a parrot, a fortune teller, a coffin-scene, Americans, Englishmen, a Canadian, and an aged yet embalmed corpse. Oh, and a rollicking dental extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s narrator, Alex Jennings, truly outdid himself. Kudos, Mr. Jennings, kudos. Much of the plot hinges on who is speaking, and how they speak. His mastery of dialect (both temporal and regional) and of tone of voice really makes this an enjoyable read. I was actually awestruck. Well done, Sir!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, there is violence. Some sex, btw. If that bothers you. But, really, this narrator&amp;hellip; Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book, although there is sex and violence which may put some readers off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Burning Bright by Tracy Chevalier</title>

        &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Chevalier, Tracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Burning bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: New York : Dutton, 2007. 9780525949787 (hardcover)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Jill Tanner. CELA library call number DA480602007. 417 pages in the paperback edition, 11 hrs., 26 min. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After suffering a tragic loss, a Dorsetshire family moves to Georgian-era London at the invitation of a circus owner. Setting up a chair-making workshop in their small upstairs apartment, the Kellaway family set about making a new life for themselves, encountering colourful neighbours such as the publisher and artist William Blake, the streetwise Maggie Butterfield and the mesmerising circus owner Philip Astley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author paints a vivid picture of life in the early 1790s, with lots ofÂ well-researched detail and an engaging plot. There are several strands to the story, which mostly follows young Jem Kellaway&amp;rsquo;s adventures through the streets of London with MaggieÂ and tells the story of his sister, Maisie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is interesting and well written. The descriptions of the time and the setting are memorable, and it feels like the book ends just a bit too soon. Jill Tanner&amp;rsquo;s narration is well done, and she is very pleasant to listen to, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very readable story with both male and female protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;
