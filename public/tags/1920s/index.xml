        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Taylor, Andrew (1951- ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: The American boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: London : Flamingo, 2003. ISBN 000710961X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Alex Jennings. CELA library call number DA29862. 400 pages in paper format; 16 hrs., 45 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar Allan Poe is the eponymous American Boy, but he is really a secondary character in the novel. He ties the actors together, but he does not play a crucial role by his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in 1819, the story follows Thomas Sheild as, newly recovered from battlefield injuries, he sets out to begin a career as Master at a boys&amp;rsquo; school outside of London. He becomes involved in a murder, and in various intrigues. He falls in love with the wrong woman, and does his best to maintain his integrity. A lot of Victorian social mores come into play. There is a parrot, a fortune teller, a coffin-scene, Americans, Englishmen, a Canadian, and an aged yet embalmed corpse. Oh, and a rollicking dental extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s narrator, Alex Jennings, truly outdid himself. Kudos, Mr. Jennings, kudos. Much of the plot hinges on who is speaking, and how they speak. His mastery of dialect (both temporal and regional) and of tone of voice really makes this an enjoyable read. I was actually awestruck. Well done, Sir!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, there is violence. Some sex, btw. If that bothers you. But, really, this narrator&amp;hellip; Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book, although there is sex and violence which may put some readers off.&lt;/p&gt;
