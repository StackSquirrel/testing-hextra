        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Gardner, Howard.
&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Five minds for the future.
&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: Boston, Mass. : Harvard Business School Press, c2007. ISBN 9781591399124.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;196 pages in the paper edition; 6hrs., 15 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;About the story&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;American developmental psychologist Howard Gardner, Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote this book to describe the intellectual skills and the type of learning he thinks will be necessary to succeed in the workplace of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He proposes five &amp;ldquo;minds&amp;rdquo;, or domains of learning, that educators, employers and individuals must foster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The disciplined mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The synthesising mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The creative mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The respectful mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ethical mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;disciplined mind&lt;/strong&gt;, he means someone who has an in-depth knowledge of her or his domain or profession (at least 10 years), and a grasp of the fundamentals of science, math, history and of other intellectual pursuits. He sees this starting at a young age, after the mastery of the basic literacies in school, and continuing to develop and deepen throughout life. He also discusses interdisciplinary learning, where mastery in more than one domain is acquired, and where the two or more domains inform the decisions and practice of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciplined mind, he explains, is a pre-requisite for the synthesising mind, a mind which can take in and organise the massive amounts of information we are faced with and then explain it in such a way that others can understand it. Synthesising ability develops from early attempts to explain what has been taught, through literature or field-of-study reviews at school or in the workplace, and ideally leading to sophisticated gathering and condensing of information in both personal and professional life. The synthesising mind understands the details but focuses on and explains the bigger picture as a whole. He distinguishes this ability from that of the creative mind, which takes the mastery of existing concepts and extends them to uncover a new concept, create a novel product or devise an effective solution. Before it can be creative, he tells us, the mind must be both disciplined and be able to synthesise. He imagines these three minds as interconnected, building upon each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;strong&gt;respectful mind&lt;/strong&gt;, approaches different people, perspectives and cultures with more than just curiosity or tolerance, but with genuine respect. This, he posits, is necessary for our very survival, and will become increasingly important as communication between different counties and cultures becomes faster and easier. He intends the term to cover inter-racial and inter-cultural relationships, as well as relationships among people from the same society or organisation who occupy different positions in the hierarchy: respect for one&amp;rsquo;s superiors and inferiors, as well as for one&amp;rsquo;s peers and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;ethical mind&lt;/strong&gt; is possessed by one who understands her or his responsibilities—both as a member of a profession and as a member of society—and who strives to fulfill them. Being ethical involves understanding what it right and using those principles guide your actions and decisions, rather than letting things like personal gain or pride derail you from the ethical path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner clearly explains the reasons he considers each of these cognitive abilities to be essential, and illustrates each section with both positive and negative examples of the qualities he describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, which originally appeared in 2007, is largely based on his previous work, &lt;em&gt;Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983)&lt;/em&gt;. He goes on to explore some of the &amp;ldquo;minds&amp;rdquo; in greater depth in later publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the book was well-written and engaging, though perhaps a bit prescriptive. It was clearly written to help teachers guide &amp;ldquo;future leaders&amp;rdquo; into specific habits of mind, and to instruct employers on what to look for in future employees (or to remediate in existing ones). The book was well-structured, following the time-honoured &amp;ldquo;say it, explain it, say it again&amp;rdquo; formula that is so essential for learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, his approach provides a useful perspective for someone who is either teaching others or continuing their own education, because it breaks down professional learning and behaviour into novel categories and encourages readers to think about their own practice in relation to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting. Not earth-shattering.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canadian copyright: A citizen&#39;s guide</title>

        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Murray, Laura J. with Samuel E. Trosow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Canadian copyright: A citizen&amp;rsquo;s guide. (2nd edition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: Toronto : Between the Lines, 2013. ISBN 9781771130134.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the book&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-book-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-book-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I initially read the first edition of this book in 2007. I was struck by how clearly the authors explained the history of copyright in Canada. They clearly demonstrate how that history informs Canadian law, and how the law informs the practice of individuals and groups across our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it is often much easier for Canadians to be informed about &amp;ldquo;fair use&amp;rdquo; (an American copyright principle, as opposed to &amp;ldquo;fair dealing&amp;rdquo;, used in Canada) and the DMCA than it is to know about the laws that govern our daily practice here in Canada. This book goes a long way towards addressing this lack of understandable information in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second edition has been revised and expanded to include the many changes brought about by [Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act]{http://copyright.ubc.ca/copyright-legislation/bill-c-11-the-copyright-modernization-act/), which amended Canadian copyright legislation in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book takes the very complicated legal framework that is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Canadian Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, explains it and makes it understandable to the layperson, providing concrete examples from case law to illustrate how the law has been interpreted. Surprisingly, it is quite readable and, at times, fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into four main parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part I — Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;, starts out with a description of why copyright came about, and examines the origin of the Canadian law by describing the evolution of the British, French and American concepts and how they influenced Canadian lawmakers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part II — Law&lt;/strong&gt;, looks at the scope of copyright (what is covered, and what is not) and contrasts owner&amp;rsquo;s rights with users&amp;rsquo; rights. It also looks at copyright collectives representing authors and owners (such as Access Copyright) and goes into how copyright ownership of a work is determined and enforced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part III — Practice&lt;/strong&gt;, discusses particular nuances of copyright application, including music; digital media; film, video and photography; visual arts; craft and design; journalism; education; and libraries, archives and museums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part IV — Contexts&lt;/strong&gt;, looks at alternatives to copyright such as Indigenous Cultural Property concepts, the academic citation economy, the Open Source Knowledge movement and phenomena such as Creative Commons and GPL licenses. It also looks towards the future, predicting what may happen in the post-Bill C-11 world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, our common daily practice brings us into almost daily contact with copyright law—knowing both our rights and what we can and cannot do (and the reason why) matters to us more with each post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explains complex copyright concepts in a very accessible manner. It should be required reading for librarians, educators and any Canadian who is interested in creator&amp;rsquo;s or user&amp;rsquo;s rights in a modern Internet-enabled world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this very readable book.&lt;/p&gt;
