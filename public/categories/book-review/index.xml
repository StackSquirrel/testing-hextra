        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Harkness, Deborah E., 1965-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: A discovery of witches; Series: All souls trilogy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A discovery of witches&lt;/strong&gt; (DA41609, ISBN9780670022410), 2011, read by Imogen Church (579 pages ; 25 hours, 31 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow of the night&lt;/strong&gt; (DA45810, ISBN9780670023486), 2012, read by  Karina Fernandez (584 pages ; 25 hours, 22 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The book of life&lt;/strong&gt; (DA49922, ISBN9780670025596 ), 2014, read by Jennifer Ikeda (561 pages; 23 hours, 55 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: New York : Viking, 2011, 2012 &amp;amp; 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a trilogy that involves vampires and time travel. No, wait! Keep reading! Not those kinds of vampires&amp;hellip; well, yes, those kind, but you hardly notice, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it sounds very cheesy but Deborah E. Harkness is an historian: the research into the time periods was done right and she writes very well. It&amp;rsquo;s very readable, and there is a tolerable amount of sex (in most vampire tales, the sex comprises most of the story and grammar is often eschewed). There is sex in a NSFW context, but not enough to leave you blushing uncontrollably as it&amp;rsquo;s read out loud to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, starting over: This is a trilogy that involves vampires and time travel. And witches. And a magic house. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting over: In &lt;em&gt;A discovery of witches&lt;/em&gt; fictional historian Diana Bishop is researching her topic on the history of science in the Bodleian library at Oxford, when she comes across an unusual manuscript, one that has been lost for hundreds of years. Magically hidden in the special collections, Diana&amp;rsquo;s reading of the book sets in motion a maze of occult happenings. Coming as she does from a long line of New England witches, Diana is aware of the book&amp;rsquo;s power and sends it back straightaway. But, it&amp;rsquo;s too late. Weird stuff happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of night&lt;/em&gt;, is mostly set in the England of the 1590s. Diana&amp;rsquo;s love Matthew reclaims his identity as a poet and spy and member of the School of the Night, a secret society of learning that runs counter to the religious zeitgeist of the times. All very cloak and dagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final book, &lt;em&gt;The book of life&lt;/em&gt;, returns to present day and to the mysterious Ashmole 782 manuscript — specifically, to the missing pages thereof. The alchemical flavours underlying the previous two books are thrust to the fore and the imagery and its significance play a huge role in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books are each read by different narrators, which slows down the re-integration of the story if, like me, you read the books over a broad-ish period of time. Despite that, this is an excellent series that is good fun and mentally engaging to read. Or, I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for period fiction (which is also true). I like the characters, I like the plots &amp;ndash; which never seem overly long &amp;ndash; and I like the way the story unfolds over several time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good for people who enjoy supernatural or historical fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Warren, Dianne, 1950-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Cool water by Dianne Warren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: Toronto : HarperCollins Canada, 2009. ISBN 9781554685585.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Kathleen Miller. CELA library call number DA38309. 328 pages in the paper edition; 9 hrs., 50 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in the small town of Juliet, Saskatchewan, this book is a series of short stories that, together, build a multi-dimensional picture of the town&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts out with an epic long-distance race between two cowboys a hundred or more years ago. Most of the stories are set in the modern era, but the past does creep in — linked by memory, relationships and places. They are stories of love, loss, happiness, sadness, teenaged angst and despair. There are horses, camels, exploding rocks and a silver tea service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a fast-moving story, it sort of meanders around like a brook. Characters appear and wander off, unrelated stories follow one another until the author&amp;rsquo;s portraits have depth, breadth and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Miller, who reads the stories, lets the book&amp;rsquo;s leisurely rhythm guide her. She does a really good job. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect, but I enjoyed the book more the longer I listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book won the Governor General&amp;rsquo;s award for fiction in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slow read for both lovers of short stories and of longer fiction, provided they are not put off by rapid changes of scenery and character.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Graham, Caroline, 1931-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: The killings at Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift
&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: London : Headline Book Publishing, 1989. ISBN 9780755342150.
DAISY audio format narrated by Hugh Ross. CELA library call number DA31505. 264 pages in the paper edition; 8 hrs., 26 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: A ghost in the machine.
&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: London : Headline, 2004. ISBN 0755307704.
DAISY audio format narrated by Terri Cherniak. CELA library call number DA26166. 375 pages in the paper edition; 19 hrs., 30 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have probably seen the &lt;strong&gt;Midsomer Murders&lt;/strong&gt; show on TV (TV Ontario has been running it in segments for decades) or on a streaming service like Netflix. They are pretty long, and not a lot happens until the end. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly character-driven with ongoing interpersonal plotlines among the principle characters, and a murder is done every show. By the end, the &amp;ldquo;bad guy&amp;rdquo; (or gal) has been apprehended, and lessons have been learnt all &amp;lsquo;round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the books on which the series is based are pretty similar. The back-story is clearer in the books, though, and the characters are more fully developed. I can see a lot more in the TV show now that I have read the books. Subtle. The second one, in particular, is quite long to listen to. Interesting, but long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CELA has not digitised too many of her books, only two of them (number 2, A ghost in the machine, in English and in French translation) and number 4, Written in blood (DA31506). The Toronto Public Library has the first one, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM3522999&amp;amp;amp;R=3522999&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The killings at Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the two that CELA has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not seen the show, Inspector Barnaby lives in a small village in the fictitious English countryside of Midsomer, where he and an ambitious, conceited, n&amp;rsquo;er-do-well Sergent solve a series of improbable murders in picturesque settings. Village characters abound, each a less likely suspect than the last until at last Barnaby reveals whodunit. The humour is dry and the pints are legion. Makes me long for good English Real Ale, sadly lacking on this side of the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift&lt;/em&gt;, an eccentric old lady insists on the investigation of the sudden, unexpected death of her best friend, a spinster living in the village of Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift. It turns out the deceased saw something she should never have seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt;, Dennis Brinkely, a beloved resident of the tiny hamlet of Forbes Abbot, is found slain amidst his horrifying collection of medieval torture devices. The only witness, Benny Fraye, is unreliable in many respects. The supernatural is consulted (albeit not by the constabulary) and the waters are muddied. If you like a good, convoluted plot, &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt; is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like them, they are long and involved and pretty easy-listening. I watch the TV series sometimes, but put a few weeks between them so they don&amp;rsquo;t get tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;

The Toronto Public Library has the first one, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM3522999&amp;amp;amp;R=3522999&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The killings at Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the two that CELA has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not seen the show, Inspector Barnaby lives in a small village in the fictitious English countryside of Midsomer, where he and an ambitious, conceited, n&amp;rsquo;er-do-well Sergent solve a series of improbable murders in picturesque settings. Village characters abound, each a less likely suspect than the last until at last Barnaby reveals whodunit. The humour is dry and the pints are legion. Makes me long for good English Real Ale, sadly lacking on this side of the pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift&lt;/em&gt;, an eccentric old lady insists on the investigation of the sudden, unexpected death of her best friend, a spinster living in the village of Badger&amp;rsquo;s Drift. It turns out the deceased saw something she should never have seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt;, Dennis Brinkely, a beloved resident of the tiny hamlet of Forbes Abbot, is found slain amidst his horrifying collection of medieval torture devices. The only witness, Benny Fraye, is unreliable in many respects. The supernatural is consulted (albeit not by the constabulary) and the waters are muddied. If you like a good, convoluted plot, &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt; is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like them, they are long and involved and pretty easy-listening. I watch the TV series sometimes, but put a few weeks between them so they don&amp;rsquo;t get tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crosstalk by Connie Willis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/crosstalk-by-connie-willis/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/crosstalk-by-connie-willis/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Willis, Connie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: New York : Del Rey, [2016]. ISBN 9780345540676.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Mia Barron. CELA library call number DA52655. 498 pages in the paper edition; 18 hrs., 45 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book follows the adventures of young Briddey Flanagan, an Irish-American woman living in a modern day where doctors have the ability to surgically increase empathy between romantic partners. Leaping at the chance to become linked to her fiancé Trent, a gorgeous young executive rocketing up the corporate ladder in her communications firm, Briddey has the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only, things do not go quite as she had expected&amp;hellip; The audiobook has a lovely narration by Mia Barron, whom I have heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the latest book (2016) by Connie Willis, whom I consider one of the most readable speculative fiction writers out there. Her quirky sense of humour and her masterful ability to imagine &amp;ldquo;what would happen if&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo; make her one of my very favourite authors. She has won numerous awards (and very deservedly so, may I say?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the CELA library only has four of her books. Public libraries often have them in audiobook (CDs) or e-audiobook (downloadable through OverDrive) formats, however, which is how I listened to most of the ones I could access. (Thank you, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?N=37920&amp;amp;amp;Ns=p_pub_date_sort&amp;amp;amp;Nso=1&amp;amp;amp;Ntt=willis%2C&amp;#43;connie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Toronto Public Library&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I encountered her was in the BRILLIANT book &lt;strong&gt;To say nothing of the dog, or, How we found the Bishop&amp;rsquo;s bird stump at last&lt;/strong&gt;. Set in a world where historians travel to various eras for research, this one features the Victorian era. I was blown away by how out-and-out hilarious this book was, and how complex and believable the plot was. I was hooked. CELA has this book, narrated by David Cutler (DA21993).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly darker is her &lt;strong&gt;Blackout&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;All clear&lt;/strong&gt; series, which CELA does not have. Set in WWII England, the time-travelling historians become embroiled in the war, its aftermath and its dangers. Compelling and readable, the historical detail is impressive and heart-wrenching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bellwether&lt;/strong&gt; (CELA DA22417, narrated by Melanie Ray) is about advertising, chaos theory and &amp;ndash; you guessed it &amp;ndash; sheep. It&amp;rsquo;s a love story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one CELA has, &lt;strong&gt;Impossible things&lt;/strong&gt; (DA20231), is a collection of short stories I am saving for when I really need cheering up. I am looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bookshare.org/search?keyword=willis%2C&amp;#43;connie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bookshare&lt;/a&gt;, of course, has everything! You need access to a DAISY player, and the ability to listen to a machine voice for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The American boy by Andrew Taylor</title>

        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Taylor, Andrew (1951- ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: The American boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: London : Flamingo, 2003. ISBN 000710961X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Alex Jennings. CELA library call number DA29862. 400 pages in paper format; 16 hrs., 45 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-story&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar Allan Poe is the eponymous American Boy, but he is really a secondary character in the novel. He ties the actors together, but he does not play a crucial role by his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in 1819, the story follows Thomas Sheild as, newly recovered from battlefield injuries, he sets out to begin a career as Master at a boys&amp;rsquo; school outside of London. He becomes involved in a murder, and in various intrigues. He falls in love with the wrong woman, and does his best to maintain his integrity. A lot of Victorian social mores come into play. There is a parrot, a fortune teller, a coffin-scene, Americans, Englishmen, a Canadian, and an aged yet embalmed corpse. Oh, and a rollicking dental extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s narrator, Alex Jennings, truly outdid himself. Kudos, Mr. Jennings, kudos. Much of the plot hinges on who is speaking, and how they speak. His mastery of dialect (both temporal and regional) and of tone of voice really makes this an enjoyable read. I was actually awestruck. Well done, Sir!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, there is violence. Some sex, btw. If that bothers you. But, really, this narrator&amp;hellip; Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Chevalier, Tracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Burning bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: New York : Dutton, 2007. 9780525949787 (hardcover)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY audio format narrated by Jill Tanner. CELA library call number DA480602007. 417 pages in the paperback edition, 11 hrs., 26 min. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the story&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-story&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Setting up a chair-making workshop in their small upstairs apartment, the Kellaway family set about making a new life for themselves, encountering colourful neighbours such as the publisher and artist William Blake, the streetwise Maggie Butterfield and the mesmerising circus owner Philip Astley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author paints a vivid picture of life in the early 1790s, with lots of well-researched detail and an engaging plot. There are several strands to the story, which mostly follows young Jem Kellaway&amp;rsquo;s adventures through the streets of London with Maggie and tells the story of his sister, Maisie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is interesting and well written. The descriptions of the time and the setting are memorable, and it feels like the book ends just a bit too soon. Jill Tanner&amp;rsquo;s narration is well done, and she is very pleasant to listen to, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: Boston, Mass. : Harvard Business School Press, c2007. ISBN 9781591399124.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;196 pages in the paper edition; 6hrs., 15 mins. as a recorded book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;About the story&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;American developmental psychologist Howard Gardner, Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote this book to describe the intellectual skills and the type of learning he thinks will be necessary to succeed in the workplace of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He proposes five &amp;ldquo;minds&amp;rdquo;, or domains of learning, that educators, employers and individuals must foster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The disciplined mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The synthesising mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The creative mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The respectful mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ethical mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;disciplined mind&lt;/strong&gt;, he means someone who has an in-depth knowledge of her or his domain or profession (at least 10 years), and a grasp of the fundamentals of science, math, history and of other intellectual pursuits. He sees this starting at a young age, after the mastery of the basic literacies in school, and continuing to develop and deepen throughout life. He also discusses interdisciplinary learning, where mastery in more than one domain is acquired, and where the two or more domains inform the decisions and practice of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciplined mind, he explains, is a pre-requisite for the synthesising mind, a mind which can take in and organise the massive amounts of information we are faced with and then explain it in such a way that others can understand it. Synthesising ability develops from early attempts to explain what has been taught, through literature or field-of-study reviews at school or in the workplace, and ideally leading to sophisticated gathering and condensing of information in both personal and professional life. The synthesising mind understands the details but focuses on and explains the bigger picture as a whole. He distinguishes this ability from that of the creative mind, which takes the mastery of existing concepts and extends them to uncover a new concept, create a novel product or devise an effective solution. Before it can be creative, he tells us, the mind must be both disciplined and be able to synthesise. He imagines these three minds as interconnected, building upon each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the &lt;strong&gt;respectful mind&lt;/strong&gt;, approaches different people, perspectives and cultures with more than just curiosity or tolerance, but with genuine respect. This, he posits, is necessary for our very survival, and will become increasingly important as communication between different counties and cultures becomes faster and easier. He intends the term to cover inter-racial and inter-cultural relationships, as well as relationships among people from the same society or organisation who occupy different positions in the hierarchy: respect for one&amp;rsquo;s superiors and inferiors, as well as for one&amp;rsquo;s peers and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;ethical mind&lt;/strong&gt; is possessed by one who understands her or his responsibilities—both as a member of a profession and as a member of society—and who strives to fulfill them. Being ethical involves understanding what it right and using those principles guide your actions and decisions, rather than letting things like personal gain or pride derail you from the ethical path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner clearly explains the reasons he considers each of these cognitive abilities to be essential, and illustrates each section with both positive and negative examples of the qualities he describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, which originally appeared in 2007, is largely based on his previous work, &lt;em&gt;Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences (1983)&lt;/em&gt;. He goes on to explore some of the &amp;ldquo;minds&amp;rdquo; in greater depth in later publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the book was well-written and engaging, though perhaps a bit prescriptive. It was clearly written to help teachers guide &amp;ldquo;future leaders&amp;rdquo; into specific habits of mind, and to instruct employers on what to look for in future employees (or to remediate in existing ones). The book was well-structured, following the time-honoured &amp;ldquo;say it, explain it, say it again&amp;rdquo; formula that is so essential for learning and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, his approach provides a useful perspective for someone who is either teaching others or continuing their own education, because it breaks down professional learning and behaviour into novel categories and encourages readers to think about their own practice in relation to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting. Not earth-shattering.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;About the book&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: Murray, Laura J. with Samuel E. Trosow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Canadian copyright: A citizen&amp;rsquo;s guide. (2nd edition)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication&lt;/strong&gt;: Toronto : Between the Lines, 2013. ISBN 9781771130134.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the book&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;about-the-book-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#about-the-book-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I initially read the first edition of this book in 2007. I was struck by how clearly the authors explained the history of copyright in Canada. They clearly demonstrate how that history informs Canadian law, and how the law informs the practice of individuals and groups across our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it is often much easier for Canadians to be informed about &amp;ldquo;fair use&amp;rdquo; (an American copyright principle, as opposed to &amp;ldquo;fair dealing&amp;rdquo;, used in Canada) and the DMCA than it is to know about the laws that govern our daily practice here in Canada. This book goes a long way towards addressing this lack of understandable information in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second edition has been revised and expanded to include the many changes brought about by [Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act]{http://copyright.ubc.ca/copyright-legislation/bill-c-11-the-copyright-modernization-act/), which amended Canadian copyright legislation in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book takes the very complicated legal framework that is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Canadian Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, explains it and makes it understandable to the layperson, providing concrete examples from case law to illustrate how the law has been interpreted. Surprisingly, it is quite readable and, at times, fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into four main parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part I — Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;, starts out with a description of why copyright came about, and examines the origin of the Canadian law by describing the evolution of the British, French and American concepts and how they influenced Canadian lawmakers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part II — Law&lt;/strong&gt;, looks at the scope of copyright (what is covered, and what is not) and contrasts owner&amp;rsquo;s rights with users&amp;rsquo; rights. It also looks at copyright collectives representing authors and owners (such as Access Copyright) and goes into how copyright ownership of a work is determined and enforced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part III — Practice&lt;/strong&gt;, discusses particular nuances of copyright application, including music; digital media; film, video and photography; visual arts; craft and design; journalism; education; and libraries, archives and museums.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part IV — Contexts&lt;/strong&gt;, looks at alternatives to copyright such as Indigenous Cultural Property concepts, the academic citation economy, the Open Source Knowledge movement and phenomena such as Creative Commons and GPL licenses. It also looks towards the future, predicting what may happen in the post-Bill C-11 world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, our common daily practice brings us into almost daily contact with copyright law—knowing both our rights and what we can and cannot do (and the reason why) matters to us more with each post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explains complex copyright concepts in a very accessible manner. It should be required reading for librarians, educators and any Canadian who is interested in creator&amp;rsquo;s or user&amp;rsquo;s rights in a modern Internet-enabled world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recommended&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recommended&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this very readable book.&lt;/p&gt;
