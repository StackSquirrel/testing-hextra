      <title>CELA now has DAISY text magazines</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;This is a very exciting development, in my opinion. I do like to read magazines from time to time, but the ones that CELA offered frankly don&amp;rsquo;t interest me (apart from L&amp;rsquo;Actualité and, sometimes, MacLean&amp;rsquo;s magazine). The new offerings include WIRED magazine, though, which makes me really happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is a DAISY book?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, DAISY is an accessible format that allows visually-impaired people to navigate books, create bookmarks, and generally use a book the way a sighted person would, only by listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAISY is an international encoding standard which, hopefully, will one day merge with the new EPUB3 standard. If this happens &amp;ndash; and the industry actually adopts that standard, another long story &amp;ndash; then books will become accessible by default at the time of publication (a huge social-justice coup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.daisy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DAISY Consortium&lt;/a&gt; makes tools available. It&amp;rsquo;s currently very difficult to make a DAISY book (but SO worth it from a visually-impaired reader&amp;rsquo;s point of view!). Trying to make one is one of the many things I have been frustrating myself with periodically in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books can be read by the computer (you have to develop an ear for this, it&amp;rsquo;s very confusing with homonyms, acronyms and words is doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognise being pronounced any old how) or they can be read out loud by actual people. This second type is much nicer to listen to, but also takes a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; longer to produce! It&amp;rsquo;s excellent for novels, short stories or any kind of fiction and the CNIB volunteers who read them are really heroes in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CELA has English and French volunteer-read books made by CNIB volunteers, but it also offers RNIB (UK), French and Australian readers. They recently made an agreement with Blackstone Audio, as well, I believe. Most of the books I review on this site are of the second variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to find the new magazines&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find CELA&amp;rsquo;s new DAISY text magazines, log in and select Newsstand. It is the second option on the Quick Links menu. This new offering greatly expands the number of accessible magazine title, and includes things like Wired magazine and The New Yorker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;CELA, together with RB Digital, is launching Canada&amp;rsquo;s first DAISY magazine service to make some of today&amp;rsquo;s most popular magazines available in a wide range of formats as soon as they are published.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The growing collection will include numerous popular titles covering news and business, decorating and cooking, sports and health, hobbies and popular culture as well as teen&amp;rsquo;s, children&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s magazines. By the end of 2017 CELA patrons will have access to more than 100 magazines.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently (near the end of March, 2017), there are 10 English-language magazines available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the original audio magazines are still available, as well. Whereas the new magazines described above are read by a computer voice (text-to-speech or TTS), these are read by volunteers in a human voice.  The audio magazine titles include MacLean&amp;rsquo;s, Canadian Geographic, Chatelaine, Good Times and Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest in English, and l&amp;rsquo;Actualité, Bel Âge, Sélection du Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest in French. There are also titles in Mandarin, Polish and Italian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to download and read them&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-to-download-and-read-them&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-download-and-read-them&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use these new magazines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. I digress. There are also a number of apps that you can use on Android and IOS, on your PC desktop or laptop, &lt;a href=&#34;http://iguana.celalibrary.ca/iguana/www.main.cls?surl=CELA-TutorialDAISYmagazinescomputer&amp;amp;amp;lang=eng&amp;amp;amp;theme=reset&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;according to the website tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. Only, the Capti Reader is not available for Android (despite what the CELA site claims, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;coming soon&amp;rdquo;). I could not get it to work on my PC, either, since it uses Flash-based interface, of which many firewalls are suspicious (for good reason). Also, most functions are only available in the Premium (paid) version, including images and different playlists, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new magazines don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work on any of the apps I currently use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an Android app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.dedicon.directtoplayer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Direct to Player&lt;/a&gt;, which was created specifically to allow you to stream CELA books to your Android device. I tried for about an hour or so, but could not get it to recognise the DAISY text magazines. However, I do use this app quite a bit for the book content, and it works well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a similar app for Bookshare content &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.benetech.android&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Go Read by Benetech&lt;/a&gt;, which I love for my professional or other non-fiction reading. Unfortunately, Go Read does not seem to work, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Bookshare books, I mostly use the in-browser reader, though, because I read at lunch and my workplace will not allow me to install AMIS, my preferred desktop DAISY-reading tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problems&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;problems&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#problems&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One problem that I did experience (and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why): I downloaded the French AMIS language pack, and installed it. You have to restart, but that all went fine and the program came back up in French (yay) and could read its own help manual in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I could  not get it to do, however, was to read the French magazine (Coup de pouce, avril 2017). I went back and tried with Les affaires : 4 mars 2017. Same issue: The Play button becomes the Pause button, and there is no way to unpause it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that is a CELA or an AMIS issue, but I supect it&amp;rsquo;s a CELA thing, since the Play button re-enables as soon as I close the French-language CELA DAISY book. Annoying. And, it means that I can&amp;rsquo;t review the French DAISY text magazines. Quel dommage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to hear if others have the same problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update: March 23, 2016 &amp;ndash; App that will read the mazagines on Android&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;update-march-23-2016----app-that-will-read-the-mazagines-on-android&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#update-march-23-2016----app-that-will-read-the-mazagines-on-android&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to hear the downloaded magazine using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redzoc.ramees.daisyreader&amp;amp;amp;hl=en%22&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DAISY Book Reader app&lt;/a&gt; from the Google Play store. It amazed me, really: I didn&amp;rsquo;t even try it &amp;ndash; it just worked! I installed the app and it automatically recognised the magazines and started reading them! &lt;strong&gt;UN&lt;/strong&gt;fortunately, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t STOP reading them. I had to turn off the device! But that&amp;rsquo;s better than not being able to read them at all. They also have a non-advertising version for about 5 dollars. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that one will stop or not (grin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update: March 26, 2016 &amp;ndash; More titles released (and still more scheduled)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;update-march-26-2016----more-titles-released-and-still-more-scheduled&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#update-march-26-2016----more-titles-released-and-still-more-scheduled&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of today (March 26), there are currently 24 DAISY text magazines in English and 6 (1 more) in French. According to CELA, many more titles will be added. This is hugely exciting (to me, at least)! Certainly, something to keep your eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, THERE IS NO TIME DELAY! April Wired was available yesterday! This is wonderful, as delays are often the norm for accessible publications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Easy 3D printing of Braille</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/easy-3d-printing-of-braille/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/easy-3d-printing-of-braille/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h1&gt;Wherein I digress&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a break from the usual book review, I thought I would talk about something cool that turned out to be very easy, thanks to my local library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my instructor at the wonderful &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hadley.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hadley School for the Blind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a correspondence school for blind people and those with low-vision (and their families). We were discussing clothing markers, which are attached to hangers and used to distinguish colours (blue, black, brown, etc.) when you can&amp;rsquo;t see them. There are various ways of doing this, using raised markers on paper or plastic tags, using Braille on tags, and there are several commercial solutions out there for this, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I have been thinking about as a librarian is the 3D printer revolution that is happening in libraries across Canada and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Seriously, check out your local public library to see if they have a 3D printer in their &amp;quot;maker space&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;innovation lab&amp;quot;. They are often inexpensive ways of making things like art or replacement parts for that pesky stroller thingy.

If your library doesn&#39;t have some a) ask them to get one (they just might, unless they are being bled a slow budgetary death, which many are) or b) ask around your community to see if there is a hack lab nearby. These are places where interested members come together, usually on a Tuesday, to make stuff and help each other learn new skills.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the conjunction of these two thoughts led me to think that 3D printing Braille clothing tags was a (nearly) obvious solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two problems: I don&amp;rsquo;t read Braille (yet, though I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; learning) and all I knew about 3D printing was that it&amp;rsquo;s a thing. So, what&amp;rsquo;s to do? Ask the Internet, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, of course, is on GitHub, where user v01pe posted a tool to generate text to 3D printable Braille. How awesome is that? It&amp;rsquo;s an online tool &amp;ndash; in German &amp;ndash; that creates a downloadable file for a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I input my text and kept contracted Braille, the default, selected. I waited for a while, about a minute or so, and there was a downloadable STL file. I put it on a thumb drive and beetled off to the maker space in my public library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy who worked there said the files were fine and ready to use. He set them up for me, trying various configurations to shorten the printing time (I was printing two of them at once), and let me choose a bright red plastic to print them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours later, and I had printed Braille! [S]ee very short video.](&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/7SZFlv8hcZc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/7SZFlv8hcZc&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I snapped off the extra printed base (you can see it on the printer shot, above) from one of them, but left the base on the other one so it could stand up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun and easy and made me feel clever, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen a lot. 🙂 Even better: the plastic they use is biodegradable, although chemically stable for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clever AND virtuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for it to be useful for my original purpose &amp;ndash; clothing markers &amp;ndash; I would need to learn a bit more: how to extend the piece and add a little hole to put the hanger&amp;rsquo;s head through. The library offers &amp;ldquo;3D printer certification&amp;rdquo; workshops, where they teach you the software and how to use it. I think I will sign up.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;Wherein I digress&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a break from the usual book review, I thought I would talk about something cool that turned out to be very easy, thanks to my local library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my instructor at the wonderful &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hadley.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hadley School for the Blind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a correspondence school for blind people and those with low-vision (and their families). We were discussing clothing markers, which are attached to hangers and used to distinguish colours (blue, black, brown, etc.) when you can&amp;rsquo;t see them. There are various ways of doing this, using raised markers on paper or plastic tags, using Braille on tags, and there are several commercial solutions out there for this, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I have been thinking about as a librarian is the 3D printer revolution that is happening in libraries across Canada and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Seriously, check out your local public library to see if they have a 3D printer in their &amp;quot;maker space&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;innovation lab&amp;quot;. They are often inexpensive ways of making things like art or replacement parts for that pesky stroller thingy.

If your library doesn&#39;t have some a) ask them to get one (they just might, unless they are being bled a slow budgetary death, which many are) or b) ask around your community to see if there is a hack lab nearby. These are places where interested members come together, usually on a Tuesday, to make stuff and help each other learn new skills.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the conjunction of these two thoughts led me to think that 3D printing Braille clothing tags was a (nearly) obvious solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two problems: I don&amp;rsquo;t read Braille (yet, though I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; learning) and all I knew about 3D printing was that it&amp;rsquo;s a thing. So, what&amp;rsquo;s to do? Ask the Internet, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, of course, is on GitHub, where user v01pe posted a tool to generate text to 3D printable Braille. How awesome is that? It&amp;rsquo;s an online tool &amp;ndash; in German &amp;ndash; that creates a downloadable file for a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I input my text and kept contracted Braille, the default, selected. I waited for a while, about a minute or so, and there was a downloadable STL file. I put it on a thumb drive and beetled off to the maker space in my public library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy who worked there said the files were fine and ready to use. He set them up for me, trying various configurations to shorten the printing time (I was printing two of them at once), and let me choose a bright red plastic to print them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours later, and I had printed Braille! [S]ee very short video.](&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/7SZFlv8hcZc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/7SZFlv8hcZc&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I snapped off the extra printed base (you can see it on the printer shot, above) from one of them, but left the base on the other one so it could stand up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun and easy and made me feel clever, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen a lot. 🙂 Even better: the plastic they use is biodegradable, although chemically stable for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
